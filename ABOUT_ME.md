- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel, 21 years and nothing else matter.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, especially the part of front-end.
     In the feature I want to study programming at the University, and move on to the Game Development.
- 🌱 I'm currently focused on learning Javascript until I can assume I'm good enough at working with it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Front-end projects.
